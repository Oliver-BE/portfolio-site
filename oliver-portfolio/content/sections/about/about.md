I'm Oliver, a Full Stack Software Engineer at Spatial Informatics Group.

I graduated from Amherst College in 2021 where I double majored in Computer Science and Statistics.

I'm especially interested in evolutionary computation, machine learning, and natural language processing. Outside of that, I enjoy photography, playing the piano, and rock climbing.
